Data Format
===========
The input of this factorization machine solver consists of a label vector (y)
and a binary sparse matrix (X). The input format is:

<label> <index_1> <index_2> ... 
.
.
.

To represent a binary sparse matrix, we only need to know where non-zero
elements are, so values are not specified.

For example, 

1 2 9 5
0 1 3 7
0 4 8 2

represents:

y          X
1   0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
0   1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0
0   0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0
